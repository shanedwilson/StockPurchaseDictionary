### StockPurchaseDictionary

This was an exercise for NSS C#/.Net

## Instructions

A block of publicly traded stock has a variety of attributes, we'll
look at a few of them. A stock has a ticker symbol and a company name.
Create a simple dictionary with ticker symbols and company names in the `Main` method.

### Example

    Dictionary<string, string> stocks = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    stocks.Add("GM", "General Motors");
    stocks.Add("CAT", "Caterpillar");
    // Add a few more of your favorite stocks

To find a value in a Dictionary, you can use square bracket notation much like JavaScript object key lookups.

    string GM = stocks["GM"]; <--- "General Motors"

Create list of ValueTuples that represents stock purchases. Properties will be `ticker`, `shares`, `price`.

    List<(string ticker, int shares, double price)> purchases = new List<(string, int, double)>();

### Example

    purchases.Add((ticker: "GE", shares: 150, price: 23.21));
    purchases.Add((ticker: "GE", shares: 32, price: 17.87));
    purchases.Add((ticker: "GE", shares: 80, price: 19.02));
    // Add more for each stock you added to the stocks dictionary
    
    //Create a total ownership report that computes the total value of each stock that you have purchased.
    //This is the basic relational database join algorithm between two tables.
    
    /*
     * Define a new Dictionary to hold the aggregated purchase information. - The key should be a string that is the full company name.
     * The value will be the valuation of each stock (price*amount) { "General Electric": 35900, "AAPL": 8445, ... }
    */
    // Iterate over the purchases and update the valuation for each stock
    foreach ((string ticker, int shares, double price) purchase in purchases)
    {
    	// Does the company name key already exist in the report dictionary?
    	// If it does, update the total valuation
    	// If not, add the new key and set its value
    }
